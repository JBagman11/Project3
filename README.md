# Project3
Hello this is my final project of COP3530C
The code will run a random generate a maze with a guarantee entry and exit( there will always be a path for both algorithms BFS and A*)
You can input from 1 to 5 with the following function of the option numbers:
Number 1 will generate a new random maze that is different than the previous random generated maze
Number 2 will implement BFS algorithm to the current maze and will show the path from start to finish, time the algorithm finds the path from start to finish, length of how many cells are there on the path and memory it took for the path
Number 3 will implement A* algorithm to the current maze and will show the path from start to finish, time the algorithm finds the path from start to finish, length of how many cells are there on the path and memory it took for the path
Number 4 will compare the both algorithms BFS and A* will give you the information like the options 2 and 3 but their respective algorithm
Number 5 will exit the program
(Additional information: To continue after picking an option and looking at the pop-up window that shows the maze, click the X mark or exit the window to continue with the program)
